# MLT-SoundExtractor
Prototype / Researching MLT format (Sound Effects containers in Shadow The Hedgehog GameCube version)

## Currently the formats are not figured out.
* .bin can access any MLT
* .bin has IDs associated with SFX bindings, and is responsible to map to MLT sound effects
* The two text files in the repo have some information regarding the formats.
